Getting the Code
=============

Checkout [depot tools](http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools), and run

        fetch v8

This will checkout V8 into the directory `v8` and fetch all of its dependencies.
To stay up to date, run

        git pull origin
        gclient sync

For fetching all branches, add the following into your remote
configuration in `.git/config`:

        fetch = +refs/branch-heads/*:refs/remotes/branch-heads/*
